Zenburn for IceWM. Couldn't find a theme that spoke to me so I made one. 

Special thanks to KERNELULTRAS/IceWM-LegacyIce-DarkTheme, which provided an excellent starting point, and the nice Slovakian user on the #icewm channel on freenode for answering my questions and showing me LegacyIce-Darktheme.

Might be a learning curve to use this theme, the buttons are just flat colours, they go like this: App Menu - window title - rollup,minimize,maximize,close
All buttons except the app menu and close button are blended into the background, but are still clickable.
